# WEEK # 3 -TRENDS IN DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS



## Pervasive networking and the modern internet

The modern lInternet is a vast interconnected collection of computer networks of many different types, with the range of types increasing all the time and now including, for example, a wide range of wireless communication technologies such as WiFi, wiMAX, Bluetooth and third-generation mobile phone networks. The net result is that networking has become a pervasive resource and devices can be connected (if desired) at any time and in any place.

The Internet is also a very large distributed system. lt enables users, wherever they are, to make use of services such as the World wide Web, email and file transfer.

## Mobile & ubiquitous Computing

Technological advances in device miniaturization and wireless networking have led increasingly to the integration of small and portable computing devices into distributed systems. These devices include:

- Laptop computers.
- Handheld devices, including mobile phones, smart phones, GPS-enabled devices, pagers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), video cameras and digital cameras.
- Wearable devices, such as smart watches with functionality similar to a PDA.
- Devices embedded in appliances such as washing machines, hi-fi systems, cars and refrigerators.

## Four Waves - Four Paradigms

- Mainframe computing (60’s-70's)
  - massive computers to execute big data processing applications
  - very few computers in the world
- Desktop computing (80'$-90's)
  - one computer at every desk to help in business-related activities
  - computers connected in intranets to a massive global network (internet), all wired
- Mobile computing (9o’s-00's)
  - a few devices for every person, small enough to carry around
  - devices connected to cellular networks or WLANs
- Ubiquitous computing (now)
  - tens/hundreds of computing devices in every room/person, becoming "invisible” and part of
    the environment
  - WANS, LANS, PANS - networking in small spaces

## Mobile Computing

- Mobile computing is the performance of computing tasks while the user is on the move, or visiting
  places other than their usual environment.
- In mobile computing, users who are away from their thome' intranet (the intranet at work, or their
  residence) are still provided with access to resources via the devices they carry with them.

## Ubicuitous Computing

• Ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) is an advanced computing concept where computing is made to
appear everywhere and anywhere.
• In contrast to desktop computing, ubiquitous computing can occur using any device, in any
location, and in any format. A user interacts with the computer, which can exist in many different
forms - laptop, tablets, terminals, phones, etc.
• Ubiquitous computing = mobile computing + intelligent environment.

## What is the difference between Ubiquitous Computing and Cloud Computing?

- ubiquitous computing refers to everyday objects becoming computing nodes, such as smart
  appliances.
- Cloud computing refers to running applications on the internet rather than locally. Services like Gmail and Flickr are examples of consumer cloud computing. Rather than reading mail or storing photos on their own machine, people can do these things on the internet instead.

## Difference between Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing

- Mobile computing: "on-the-go", e.g., while sitting on a train; possibility of network connections remaining
  open.
- Computing everywhere... OR computers everywhere..most of them invisible.
- From the point of view of distributed systems, there is no essential difference between mobile and ubiquitous computing

## Wearable ComputingE

- Devices attached to clothes, worn like watches, jewellery, etc.

## Context-Aware Computing

- Device will automatically switch itself to “vibrate" instead of "ring” when it is in the cinema is a
  example of context-aware computing.
